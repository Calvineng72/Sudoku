# Sudoku

Sudoku is a web-application built with Next.js and Material UI that creates sudoku puzzles and allows users to solve them. Users may receive assistance from the "check" and "solve" buttons, which checks their progress and solves the puzzle, respectively. The goal of the project was to solidify understandings of API fetches and gain more practice with frontend engineering. In the future, I hope to implement the Algorithm X with Dancing Links to solve sudoku puzzles, as it is faster than the already implemented backtracing algorithm. 

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Calvineng72/Sudoku.git
      
Then, install the required dependencies: 
 
    cd frontend
 
    npm install
      
Next, run the development server:

    npm run dev
    
Finally, execute the backend server and go to the following link:

    http://localhost:3000
